# CSC372_Project1_TextGame
Disclaimers
  I wanted to try to building a small game since game development is one of C#'s strong point but it might have been a little ambitious.
  To keep things simple I wanted to see if I could build this online text based game in C# 
  (http://play2.textadventures.co.uk/Play.aspx?id=7nwoee9ope2_hvfrx8kjvw), which is why they look pretty similar. Due to my unfamiliarity 
  with winforms and game development I was not able to build most elements of the ui such at the map and menus. It would have been a lot 
  simpler if I has just build it as a console application but here we are with some spaghetti code and a dream. The game itself is pretty 
  barebones and is more of a demo really than a game but it took a surprising amount of work. As a heads up, it seems on some computers 
  that the gui doesn't open in the correct size so you might have to resize the window to get access to the text input at the bottom.

Instructions for running the game (Assuming you are on Windows).
Using the Executable:
  1. On the repositories main page (https://github.com/Savaesthetic/CSC372_Project1_TextGame), 
  you should see a green drop down menu with the label Code. Click it.
  2. Download the ZIP.
  3. Open the ZIP and extract the Game folder somewhere, probably just onto your desktop, you dont need any of the 
  other folders or files unless you want to look at the code which can also simply be done through the github repository.
  4. Run the CSC372_Project1.exe file from inside the game folder.
  5. Windows might scream about the executable being unsafe since it's from an unknown publisher. If you dont trust 
  the executable you can try running the game through visual studio.
Using Visual Studio:
  a. If you don't have Visual Studio installed you can follow this tutorial (https://www.guru99.com/download-install-visual-studio.html)
  and make sure you have the .Net desktop development workload installed or you won't be able to run the program.
  b. On the repositories main page (https://github.com/Savaesthetic/CSC372_Project1_TextGame), 
  you should see a green drop down menu with the label Code. Click it.
  c. Download the ZIP.
  d. Open the Zip, navigate into the CSC372_Project1_TextGame-master folder, extract all of the files and folders into a folder 
  wherever you want. It's easy to just put it on the desktop.
  e. Open Visual Studio and navigate to the File dropdown in the top left corner. Hover over it and go to Open->Project/Solution.
  f. Navigate to where you extracted the zipped file, enter the folder and select the CSC372_Project1.sln.
  g. The solution should be built using the files in the folder so you should be able to run the program by hitting the start
  button with the green arrow in the top toolbar.
